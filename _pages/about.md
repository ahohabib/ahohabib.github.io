I graduated from Khulna University of Engineering & Technology (KUET), one of Bangladesh's most prestigious public engineering institutions, with a bachelor's degree in Civil Engineering. Currently, I am working in the as a Manager in chinese EPC company PowerChina Fujian Engineering Co., Ltd. where I am involved in Design, Supply, Installation, Testing and Commissioning of 132kV, 230kV and 400kV high voltage power transmission line on Turnkey Basis of approx. 900km

My Interests
------
With some background in programming I want to be a part of the digital transformation in construction, civil engineering, architecture, transportation, and related fields. My passion for digital transformation in civil engineering, smart cities and related fields to address specific challenges in infrastructure planning, design, construction, operation, and management, and the skills to identify business opportunities created by digital twins. To prepare myself for the future challenges, I practice Python and R programming every day to improve my understanding of data analytics and machine learning, which will aid me in conducting advanced scientific research.


My motivation
------
Bangladesh's infrastructure sector has always been problematic due to the region's dense population, harsh weather, corruption and environmental pollution. I want to support my country by becoming an expert researcher, and earning a MS/PhD degree will allow me to train myself in finding, evaluating, and documenting research problems methodologically for the betterment of my society.
